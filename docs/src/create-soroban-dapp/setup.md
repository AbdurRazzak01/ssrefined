## Introduction
This documentation provides detailed steps to successfully set up and deploy your Soroban-based decentralized application (DApp) using **@create-soroban-dapp**. This guide ensures you can quickly start your project with a robust boilerplate DApp built on **@soroban-react**.
 

`@create-soroban-dapp` is both an npx script and a boilerplate DApp, inspired by the ink!athon project by Scio Labs and @create-t3-app by T3 Open Source for script mechanisms.

## Dependencies
To successfully set up a Soroban DApp, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- **Docker**: Required for containerized environment setup.
- **Node.js**: Version 12 or higher.
- **npm** or **yarn**: Package managers for managing Node.js packages.


## Installation Instructions
### Step-by-Step Instructions to Install the dependencies

### Docker
Docker is an essential tool for containerization, which allows you to package and run your applications in isolated environments.

#### Steps to Install Docker

1. **Download Docker:**
   - Visit the [Docker official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download Docker Desktop for your operating system.

2. **Install Docker:**
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the Docker website for your specific OS.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify Docker is installed correctly:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
   - You should see the Docker version information if the installation was successful.
  



### Node.js 

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js.

#### Windows

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Visit the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the Windows Installer (MSI) for the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version.

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Run the downloaded `.msi` installer.
   - Follow the installation prompts and accept the license agreement.
   - Choose the installation path (default is recommended).
   - Ensure that the "Install npm" option is checked.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open Command Prompt and run the following commands:
     ```sh
     node --version
     npm --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

#### macOS

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Visit the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the macOS Installer (PKG) for the latest LTS version.

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Open the downloaded `.pkg` installer.
   - Follow the installation prompts and accept the license agreement.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open Terminal and run the following commands:
     ```sh
     node --version
     npm --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

#### Linux

1. **Use NodeSource Binaries (recommended for most distributions):**

   - Open Terminal and run the following commands to install Node.js and npm:
     ```sh
     curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
     ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Run the following commands:
     ```sh
     node --version
     npm --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

### Installing Yarn

Yarn is an alternative package manager to npm, known for its speed and reliability.

#### Windows

1. **Install via npm:**
   - Open Command Prompt and run:
     ```sh
     npm install --global yarn
     ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     yarn --version
     ```

     ```sh
     brew install yarn
     ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     yarn --version
     ```

  # or
  yarn add express
  ```

- **Running a Script:**
  ```sh
  npm run <script-name>
  # or
  yarn run <script-name>
  ```

- **Updating Packages:**
  ```sh
  npm update
  # or
  yarn upgrade
