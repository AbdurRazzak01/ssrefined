# @create-soroban-dapp

@create-soroban-dapp is both a npx script and a boilerplate dapp for kickstarting any of your ideas for a Soroban-based Dapp.

Largely inspired by the [ink!athon](https://github.com/scio-labs/inkathon) project by [Scio Labs](https://github.com/scio-labs) and by [@create-t3-app](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) by [T3 Open Source](https://github.com/t3-oss) for the script mechanisms.

Check the [`LIVE VERSION`](https://create-soroban-dapp.vercel.app/) of the dapp utilizing already deployed testnet contract!
